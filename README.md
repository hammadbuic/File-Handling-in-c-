# File-Handling-in-c-
A simple program to show the work of file handling and dynamic arrays in C++.


Problem Statement:
Create a text file containing 300 names of students, their father’s name and their CNIC numbers. Leading on from the above system, you have to alter its main(). Now make this system in such away that on run time, it should be able to generate random intake of students. The program must be generated randomly, while the student name, father name and CNIC must be read from a text file that should contain information of 300 students.
For example.
Random program selected 	: Computer Engineering
			Name	: Roshan Iqbal
		Father’s Name	: Iqbal Khan
			CNIC	: 12345-5123412-1
Random program selected	: Software Engineering
Name	: Amjad Ali
		Father’s Name	: Ali Shah
			CNIC	: 12345-5123412-1
Random program selected	: Software Engineering
			Name	: Nayelaw Ali
		Father’s Name	: Ali Nawazish
			CNIC	: 12345-5123412-1
Random program selected	: LLB
			Name	: Fatima Awais
		Father’s Name	: Awais Khan
			CNIC	: 12345-5123412-1
							And so on…
All the basic requirements from question 1 are applied here as well along with the following requirements:
V)	Find students with duplicate CNIC numbers.
VI)	Find student with name
VII)	Find student with CNIC
A menu-based program is required here. The user should be able to press a key (without pressing enter) to select a particular option. (If I am pressing 1 to go to finding all the students who have applied, the system should be able to do so by me ONLY pressing 1, instead of pressing 1 and then pressing enter key.)
